# Boss Machine 

##Â Tech-stack

React, Node.js, Express.js, SQLite. 

### Project Overview

In this project, I created an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. 

Project has come from Codecademy, completed when partaking web development pathway course. I completed everything from within the server directory and server.js, as the goal of this project was to simply learn how to create a backend API in Express.js.

The rest is boilerplate code provided by <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/PRO/skill-paths/backend-javascript/projects/boss-machine/project-4-boss-machine-start.zip" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>
